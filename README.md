# OpenHack - Serverless

![function app](https://github.com/kevinhillinger/oh-serverless-coaching/workflows/function%20app/badge.svg)

My solution to the serverless open hack that Microsoft runs.

## What you might glean from this codebase?

-   TypeScript build that works with Azure Functions
-   TypeScript with Azure Functions v3
-   Durable Functions using TypeScript
-   Structuring your project while still using Azure Functions without creating a big ball of wax
-   Azure CLI setup of Azure Functions resources
-   some very simplistic but useful Log Analytics queries
